                Hi my name is Nathan Harris and I created <a class="has-text-link has-text-weight-bold" href="https://github.com/nathanjh-28/Borrow-This">Borrow This ! </a> as a Capstone Project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.  I come from the entertainment industry where I worked as a lighting console programming and carried with me a fascination for the systems that make movies.  Now that fascination as shifted as I change focus from the big screen to the computer screen, enjoying all the complexities herein.  The idea of this project came from my friends always asking me to borrow a camping tent or my camera and my desire to help people use my film equipment.  I quickly realized that there are all kinds of items that people might be willing to rent and wouldn't it be cool if there was ONE place to view them?  I built this project with full stack Python Django, PostgreSQL for the database, and Bulma for the CSS Library.  I am really proud of this project as I tried to cram as many features as I could in one week.  I hope you get to enjoy it!
